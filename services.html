These services support customers’ IT initiatives by providing strategic, architectural, operational and implementation planning. Strategic planning includes advisory services that help clients assess their IT needs and formulate system implementation plans. Architecture planning includes advisory services that combine strategic plans and knowledge of emerging technologies to create the logical design of the system and the supporting infrastructure to meet customer requirements. Operational assessment/benchmarking include services that assess the operating efficiency and capacity of a client’s IT environment. Implementation planning includes services aimed at advising customers on the rollout and testing of new solution deployments

                <p class="mb-4" style="font-size: 21px;">A managed IT service is an information technology (IT) task provided by a third-party contractor and delivered to a customer.

                    In a managed service arrangement, the managed service provider retains responsibility for the functionality of the IT service and equipment, and the customer typically pays a monthly fee for receipt of the service. There are many different types of managed IT service offerings, but the idea behind all of them is to transfer the burden of maintaining IT from the customer to a service provider. In an effective managed services relationship, a customer benefits from predictable pricing and the ability to focus on core business concerns rather than IT management chores.</p>

                <p class="mb-4" style="font-size: 21px;">Data analytics is the science of analyzing raw data to make conclusions about that information. Many of the techniques and processes of data analytics have been automated into mechanical processes and algorithms that work over raw data for human consumption.

                        <li>System software: to provide core functions such as operating systems, disk management, utilities, hardware management and other operational necessities.</li>
                        <li>Programming software: to give programmers tools such as text editors, compilers, linkers, debuggers and other tools to create code.</li>
                        <li>Application software: (applications or apps) to help users perform tasks.

                <p class="mb-4" style="font-size: 21px;">Cyber security is the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks. It's also known as information technology security or electronic information security. The term applies in a variety of contexts, from business to mobile computing, and can be divided into a few common categories.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>  Network security: is the practice of securing a computer network from intruders, whether targeted attackers or opportunistic malware..</li>
                        <li>Application security: focuses on keeping software and devices free of threats. A compromised application could provide access to the data its designed to protect. Successful security begins in the design stage, well before a program or device is deployed</li>
                        <li>  Information security: protects the integrity and privacy of data, both in storage and in transit.</li>
